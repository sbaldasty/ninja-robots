# Ninja Robots

This is the result of an experiment in language design and writing an interpreter, and is similar to Karel the Robot. There are up to four teams of robots, each of which has its own algorithm that all members operate on. The algorithm runs once per robot per turn, and decides what the robot is going to do on that turn. Each robot also has a memory with which to preserve state between turns.

I wrote this back in 2004, my undergraduate senior project. I just framed the code base in an Eclipse project, fixed all the compiler warnings, and uploaded a branch to Google Code... And now again to GitHub...
